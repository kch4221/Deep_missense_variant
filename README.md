## Deep Missense Variants
This project contain scripts to predict the missense variant effect with deep learning models. 
This project contains two steps:
1. Feature extraction (Get MSA)
    Use jackhmmer to get the MSA of the protein sequence in specific domain.
2. Predict the missense variant effect with deep learning models.
    Use the MSA to train the deep learning models.
    Predict the missense variant effect with the trained models.
